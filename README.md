# Algorithms_Sedgewick
I present the complete solution manual for the exercises in Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne 4th edition. While there already exist some solutions on GitHub, I wanted to present my understanding of the vital concepts presented in this book for future self-learners and beginners.

Excerpt from book: "Algorithms is one of the most popular textbooks on algorithms today and is widely used in colleges and universities worldwide."
